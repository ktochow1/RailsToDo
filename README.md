# README

RailsToDo is your Task-List Manager!
After forking this repository to your local environment, run `bundle install` to access all necessary gems and dependencies.
Run `rails s` in your terminal. This will open a rails server whose domain is located
at http://localhost:3000 .
To get started, go to http://localhost:3000/login to sign up.
After submitting an email and password, you will be directed to the home page 
(upon signing up, you will have the ability to login through facebook at later logins).
From there create a new List.
A list will be connected to a Project assignment. 
**** You must create a list before any other feature **** 

After a new list is created, you can create a new Project Assignment, 
add your newly created list, and start making tasks for your list.

You'll have the ability to Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks, project assignments, and lists.

Additionally, you'll have access to see what other users are working on and can build on to their project assignments!

Get organized and have fun!
